            <p class="font-ui text-base mb-4">Hi, my name is Hugo Silva and I'm a product engineer from Lisbon. I love building great software, and I love it even more when it's intuitive to use.</p>
            
            <p class="font-ui text-base mb-4">I started coding at 12. My first project was a SpongeBob game with Pac-Man style gameplay and The Real Slim Shady looping in the background. It was a mess, but the moment it ran and I could actually play it, my brain lit up. It never turned off after that.</p>
            
            <p class="font-ui text-base mb-4">I’ve been building software professionally for more than 15 years and during that time I had a great opportunity to play startup co-founder role. I've seen it grow from a hand of people to more than 300. Scaling a service to handle millions of translations per month, and experience all the rollercoasters of managing a business.</p>

            <p class="font-ui text-base mb-4">When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm tending to the garden, drawing, writing, or hanging out with my family.</p>

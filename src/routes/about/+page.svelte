            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                Hi, I’m Hugo Silva, a software engineer from Lisbon. I love
                creating things that people use, whether games, tools, or full
                products. I care about making them simple and intuitive.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                I started coding at 12. My first project was a game, with
                SpongeBob chasing dots like Pac-Man while “The Real Slim Shady”
                played on loop for no good reason. When it finally ran and I
                could play something I had built from scratch, something
                clicked, and I went from user to builder.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                That shift stuck. Over the last 15+ years, I’ve built software
                professionally. Along the way, I stepped into a startup
                co-founder role and was part of a team that grew from a handful
                of people to more than 300. As we scaled, I worked on systems
                handling billions of translations and experienced the chaos of
                rapid growth firsthand, shipping fast, breaking things, fixing
                them, and learning what it really takes to build a business.
            </p>
            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                What hasn’t changed since that first messy game is the goal:
                build things that feel simple on the surface and solid
                underneath.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                When I’m not in front of a screen, I’m usually in the garden,
                attempting a craft I’m unqualified for, or spending time with
                family and friends.

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                Hi, my name is Hugo Silva and I'm a product engineer from
                Lisbon. I love building great software, and I love it even more
                when it's intuitive to use.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                I started coding at 12. My first project was a SpongeBob game
                with Pac-Man style gameplay and it had The Real Slim Shady
                looping in the background. It was a mess, but the moment it ran
                and I could actually play it, my brain lit up. It never turned
                off after that.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                I’ve been building software professionally for more than 15
                years and during that this I had a great opportunity to play a
                startup co-founder. I've seen it grow from a hand of people to
                more than 300. Scaling a service to handle millions of
                translations per month, and experience all the rollercoasters of
                managing a business.
            </p>

            <p class="font-ui text-lg mb-4">
                When I'm not in front of a screen, you can find me tending the
                garden, messing around with a craft I don’t actually know how to
                do, or hanging out with my family and friends.
